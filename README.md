# Important questions to remember 

- why change from cli to web 
  - cause the visuals were not that attractive as aspected and we had barrier in implementing our ideas related to design

- why typescript and not javascript 
  - we can say typescript as an advance version of javascript which means anything that we know about javascipt is funtional over here also 
  - in addition to that typescript gives us more funtionality and the major one is typescript is OOP based programming language while java script is cli type(need to know the exact word of it) langugage


- using primereact for terminal(rich set of OSS component UI for react)
